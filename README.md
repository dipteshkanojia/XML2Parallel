# XML2Parallel

### Requirements
- XML files with parallel data
- "<source>" and "<target>" tags to be present in the files, or else can be replaced.

The code assumes you have XML files with tags "<source>" and "<target>" which contain source side-sentences and target side-translations.
It attempts to provide one with a dataframe of parallel sentences and can help generate parallel corpus.
