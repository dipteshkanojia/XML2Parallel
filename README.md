# XML2Parallel

### Requirements
- XML files with parallel data
- "source" and "target" tags to be present inside the XML files (containing text inside), or else these tags can be replaced in the code

### Description

The code assumes you have XML files with tags "source" and "target" which contain source side-sentences and target side-translations.
It attempts to provide one with a dataframe of parallel sentences and can help generate parallel corpus.
